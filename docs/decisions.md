# Durable decisions

This log keeps cross-cutting rationale that is not clearer in code, tests, the command contract, or the security contract.

Decision: Use Go with a conventional `cmd/` and `internal/` layout.
Context: Multicodex needs a portable local CLI with strong filesystem control and a small deployment surface.
Rationale: Go provides a static binary, mature standard library, straightforward concurrency, and familiar public-project structure.
Trade-offs: Go is more verbose than shell, and Windows remains unsupported.
References: `go.mod`, `cmd/multicodex/`, `internal/`

Decision: Produce release binaries only from version tags and inject one shared version.
Context: Public binaries need clear provenance, consistent CLI and provider-client identification, and checksums without hand-edited version constants.
Rationale: A tag-triggered workflow gives every target the same version and makes publication explicit.
Trade-offs: Untagged builds report a development version; release targets are limited to macOS and Linux on AMD64 and ARM64.

Decision: Keep non-default account use entirely inside profile-local `CODEX_HOME` directories.
Context: Auth, sessions, threads, `/goal`, and other Codex state belong together, while the shared default Codex account remains outside multicodex ownership.
Rationale: Profile-local process environments let concurrent accounts operate without switching or sharing state. The default home can still serve as a protected final routing reserve and read-only monitor source without becoming managed state.
Trade-offs: Users must sign in separately on each machine and use `cli --account` when they need a specific profile.

Decision: Fail closed when profile filesystem ownership or auth isolation is ambiguous.
Context: Symlinks, hard links, permissive modes, path aliases, inherited account environment, and repository-local state can cross account or secret boundaries.
Rationale: Canonical path checks, private permissions, atomic writes, environment scrubbing, and narrow ownership rules keep failures visible and reduce the chance of changing or exposing another account's state.
Trade-offs: Some valid-looking custom layouts are rejected, and diagnostics intentionally omit raw external failure text.

Decision: Default persistent multicodex state to `~/multicodex`.
Context: Users may work from multiple repositories and worktrees.
Rationale: One stable home-level location avoids fragmented or accidentally committed profile state.
Trade-offs: Users who need another location must set `MULTICODEX_HOME`.
References: `internal/multicodex/paths.go`, `README.md`

Decision: Keep inspection commands non-mutating and provide one explicit reconciliation command.
Context: Help, completion, status, doctor, monitor, and dry-run are used as safe probes, while unattended resource maintenance still needs a supported path.
Rationale: Read-only discovery should never create state. `reconcile` reuses the established ownership and no-clobber rules without making inspection commands surprising.
Trade-offs: Resource changes require a separate explicit command or a profile-scoped launch path.

Decision: Keep heartbeat profile-scoped, minimal, ephemeral, and cron-safe.
Context: A keepalive must verify logged-in profiles without persisting a session, touching a workspace, overlapping another run, or exposing subprocess output.
Rationale: A fixed read-only `hello`, bounded retry, and local non-blocking lock provide useful liveness with a narrow side-effect and reporting surface.
Trade-offs: Each logged-in profile sends a real request, and redacted failures provide less provider detail.

Decision: Integrate subscription monitoring under `multicodex monitor`.
Context: Account isolation and remaining subscription headroom are part of the same account-selection workflow.
Rationale: One product avoids a split workflow. Validated profile homes may use profile-scoped app-server reads with OAuth fallback; unvalidated homes stay on direct OAuth so their credential-store behavior is not guessed.
Trade-offs: Monitoring adds dependencies and may start read-only app-server processes for validated profiles. Transient full outages retain clearly marked stale official data rather than blanking useful context.

Decision: Normalize usage and routing around weekly default and Spark limits only.
Context: Weekly subscription limits are the useful account-selection signal, while older payloads may omit declared durations and expose the weekly window only in the secondary position.
Rationale: One weekly model keeps the monitor, metadata, observed estimates, and exec eligibility aligned. Declared 10,080-minute windows win; only the established secondary-position fallback remains for older payloads.
Trade-offs: Obsolete shorter limits are not exposed. Spark routing depends on a Spark model name and a Spark bucket for configured profiles.

Decision: Keep the default Codex home as the final automatic-routing reserve.
Context: A prompt should still have a destination when configured profiles are exhausted or unavailable.
Rationale: Automatic interactive and non-interactive launches share one weekly-aware selector. The unmanaged default home is used only after configured profiles cannot accept the request and the official Codex CLI confirms its login. Checking at selection time supports both file and OS keyring credential stores without treating `auth.json` presence as account state.
Trade-offs: Automatic `cli` startup now depends on a bounded usage check. Selecting the default adds one bounded login-status subprocess. If its status is logged out or unavailable, automatic routing fails before launch even when the underlying credentials might recover later.

Decision: Share normal Codex configuration defaults while preserving profile-local overrides.
Context: Model, reasoning, permission, and other Codex preferences should stay consistent across default and profile sessions without copied configuration.
Rationale: New profiles link to the default `config.toml`; regular profile config files remain explicit overrides. Every effective profile config must still select file-backed auth.
Trade-offs: A default config change affects linked profiles, and manual overrides must maintain their own compatible settings.

Decision: Keep profile guidance and skill sharing optional and no-clobber.
Context: Some users need common guidance or several skill sources, while existing profiles may contain intentional local files and runtime-managed `.system` skills.
Rationale: One optional `profile_resources` policy manages only documented symlink positions, preserves regular local overrides, and leaves omitted settings on their established behavior.
Trade-offs: Explicit management may retarget or remove symlinks at owned positions, so every such change is reported.

Decision: Add one-shot harness-free generation through Codex App Server, with no tools by default and optional native live web search.
Context: Subscription authentication is useful for general text generation, but `codex exec` always includes the client-side coding-agent harness. The official Codex SDK exposes the same agent behavior and is not a Go dependency.
Rationale: A small App Server client reuses existing profile routing and managed ChatGPT authentication. An exact Codex version gate, the built-in OpenAI provider and endpoint, optional bounded instruction files, disabled context and MCP servers, a one-model catalog with agent-tool metadata removed, and fail-closed event handling keep coding tools out of the provider request. Explicit `--search` can expose the provider's native live web-search tool without adding the coding-agent harness. Model-catalog effort validation, App Server output schemas, and sanitized JSON metrics support controlled experiments without exposing raw events or account identity. Normal tolerant config loading preserves unrelated user-owned Codex settings that strict parsing can reject.
Trade-offs: The command is one-shot, requires a tested Codex version, and must be updated when the experimental protocol changes. Search is opt-in and limited to the native provider tool. JSON mode buffers a bounded response. Provider-side instructions remain outside client control.

Decision: Build the editor as a local TUI over dedicated host-local tmux servers.
Context: One client must reconnect quickly to many local and SSH project terminals without a daemon, terminal transcript database, or cross-host coordination.
Rationale: A small Go TUI keeps one warm protocol connection per host, renders only the selected PTY, and checks every managed session plus a bounded tmux capture every two seconds. Each project can lazily own one terminal in its configured original directory without a workspace or worktree; named workspaces remain separate. Stable health text, a fixed-width pulse, and simple output, running, stopped, offline, and unavailable markers expose that state without layout movement, one client process per window, or a fixed window limit. Editor-created sessions retain an exited pane, so a reachable refresh can treat `exit` as a safe window removal while still preserving a missing session after host restart. Deterministic session names and exact environment ownership markers make reconnection and cleanup simple. The outer editor stays outside tmux, and managed servers disable prefix keys and bindings, which removes nested-session ambiguity. The explicit host protocol is the compatibility boundary, so clean builds can roll forward without stopping tmux sessions and incompatible protocol changes fail closed with a clear outer-editor restart instruction.
Trade-offs: Only one terminal is visible at a time. Command-key shortcuts and the modifier for overriding mouse reporting depend on the terminal emulator. Cell mouse mode supports clicks and wheels, not pointer hover or drag gestures. Modified development builds cannot connect remotely. A protocol-changing rollout can show a host as offline until installation finishes and the outer editor reopens, but it does not stop or alter that host's sessions.

Decision: Give each editor instance a private host registry and two-phase resource lifecycle.
Context: Git worktrees, branches, tmux sessions, and attachments can outlive a client process or be left half-created after sleep, SSH loss, or a failed state write.
Rationale: The client stores minimal navigation state. Each host records exact ownership and workspace, window, or attachment intent before external mutation. One host-local operation lock serializes lifecycle changes across connections. Startup and hourly reconciliation can then resume known operations and refuse uncertain ones without scanning or changing unrelated projects. Automatic cleanup never removes Git worktrees because external writers cannot be excluded between a safety check and deletion. Force consent is invocation-local and is never replayed after interruption.
Trade-offs: Loss of the client instance identifier prevents automatic adoption of its old resources. Stale Git workspaces require explicit deletion after review, while safe cleanup still removes exact dead windows, expired attachments, and stale non-Git records.

Decision: Separate preserved resources from editor-created resources with two explicit flags.
Context: Users need to adopt existing tmux sessions without moving or stopping them, and need normal multi-branch Git work inside editor worktrees.
Rationale: `Workspace.External` identifies a preserved project checkout and `Window.Adopted` identifies a preserved default-server tmux session. Release only clears exact markers and registry state. Editor-created worktrees instead use one stable ownership lock, while the current checkout branch remains ordinary mutable Git state. The recorded initial branch defines the only branch the editor can delete.
Trade-offs: Adoption is intentionally narrow: the session must be detached, ungrouped, single-pane, unmarked, and at the exact configured project root. Complex tmux layouts stay outside editor ownership.
